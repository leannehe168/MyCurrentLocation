get current location using Android LocationManager
FYI

Issue : 
In an effort to reduce power consumption, Android 8.0 (API level 26) limits how frequently an app can retrieve the user's current location while the app is running in the background. Under these conditions, apps can receive location updates only a few times each hour. 
 
location listener can receive location updates only a few times per hour, when the app is running in the background.
